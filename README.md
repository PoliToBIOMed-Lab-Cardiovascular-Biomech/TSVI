# TSVI
Tutorials and codes for TSVI calculation from wall shear stress (WSS) data

The topological shear variation index (TSVI) measures the variability of the local contraction/expansion action exerted on the endothelium by the WSS along the cardiac cycle.
Methods for WSS analysis and visualization are explained in a tutorial video showing how TSVI can be obtained from CFD-derived WSS data in the open-source Paraview environment.

$$TSVI=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int\limits_0^T \left[DIV_{WSS}-\overline{DIV_{WSS}}\right]^2} dt$$
