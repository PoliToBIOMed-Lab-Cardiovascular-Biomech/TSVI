# TSVI
Tutorials and codes for TSVI calculation from wall shear stress (WSS) data

The topological shear variation index (TSVI) measures the variability of the local contraction/expansion action exerted on the endothelium by the WSS along the cardiac cycle.

TSVI = {1/T ∫_0^T▒〖[DIV_WSS-(DIV_WSS ) ̅ ]^2 dt〗}^(1/2)
